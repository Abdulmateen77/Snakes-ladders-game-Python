## 1. Introduction
The Snakes and Ladders GUI Game is an interactive graphical user interface implementation of the classic Snakes and Ladders board game. This project utilizes Python's graphic libraries such as Turtle, Random, and Tkinter to create an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience. Players can choose GIF characters, view a scoreboard, change the interface color, and enjoy the traditional gameplay of moving through the board by climbing ladders and avoiding snakes.

3. Navigate to the game directory using the terminal or command prompt.
4. Install required dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the game script:
   ```
   python snakes_and_ladders_gui.py
   ```

- Traditional snakes and ladders gameplay with automatic position adjustments.
- Interactive dice rolling mechanism.
- User-friendly GUI for an enjoyable gaming experience.

## 5. Technical Details
The Snakes and Ladders GUI Game is built using the following technologies and libraries:
- Python programming language (version 3.6 or higher)
- Tkinter library for creating the graphical user interface.
- Turtle library for drawing the game board.
- Random library for dice rolling and random events.
- GIF images for player characters.
- Modular programming approach for code organization and maintainability.

## 6. Modular Approach
The game follows a modular structure to enhance code readability, reusability, and maintainability. The codebase is divided into several modules, each responsible for specific functionalities. The main modules include:
- `snakes_and_ladders.py`: The main script that integrates the GUI components, game logic, and modules.
- `gameinterface.py`: Manages the drawing of the game board using the Turtle library.
- `player.py`: Defines the Player class, handles player information, and GIF character selection.
- `numbers.py`: Implements the dice rolling mechanism using the Random library.
- `squares.py`: Manages the display of the scoreboard using Tkinter.
